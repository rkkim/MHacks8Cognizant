# Cognizant

watch out 

This is a re-upload.

Our goal was to create an app that would help warn users when they're in an area of high crime rate of Detroit. We accomplished using heat-layer on top of Apple Maps, and using Open Data provided by the City of Detroit. Additional features include filtering crime rate by time, and different sized heat map clustering depending on the zoom rate. Future updates may include finalizing iBeacon integration to let users know when they're in an area of high crime rate while the app is running in the background (GPS uses too much battery).
